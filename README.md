# Civilization Game Project

Personal project to explore the development of a round-based strategy game using modern OpenGL and Python.

This is a technical playground for learning and implementing core mechanics of a civilization-building game with a custom rendering pipeline.

## 🚧 Current Status

- GLFW window setup complete
- Basic OpenGL context configured
- First vertices rendered
- Modular structure prepared for future logic and rendering systems

The game is still in early development. No gameplay mechanics or assets are revealed publicly yet.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Graphics: Modern OpenGL (core profile)
- Windowing: GLFW
- Math: GLM (for vectors and matrices)

## 📁 Folder Structure (planned)

- src/ - Core code and rendering logic
- shaders/ - Vertex and fragment shaders
- assets/ - Future textures and models

## 📝 Notes

This project is focused on building a solid foundation for a complex strategy game. The architecture is being designed to support scalable logic and dynamic rendering.

More updates coming soon.
